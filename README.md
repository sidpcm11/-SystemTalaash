We have developed an autonomous system through which faces captured by the cameras are compared with the criminal/missing person database in live video feeds and if any face is found similar, then an instant alert will be sent to the officials through SMS and e-mails. At the same time, their photos will be displayed on the app/website having their current date, time, and location. It helps officials in catching criminals and missing people faster with very high accuracy. It can work (24*7) without any human interference.
